# Unit Conversion System (CLI-Based)

**Project Timeline:** September â€“ November 2024  
**Language:** C  
**Platform:** Command Line Interface (Terminal)

## ðŸ”§ Project Overview

This project was developed as part of my C programming learning phase. Itâ€™s a CLI-based tool that performs various unit conversions and basic calculations directly through the terminal. This allowed me to improve my understanding of core C concepts and apply real-world problem-solving logic.

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… **Mass Conversion** (mg, g, kg, ton, pound)  
- âœ… **Length Conversion** (mm, cm, m, km, inch, feet, yard, mile)  
- âœ… **Time Conversion** (seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years)  
- âœ… **Area Conversion** (sq.mm, sq.cm, sq.m, acre, hectare)  
- âœ… **Temperature Conversion** (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin)  
- âœ… **BMI Calculator** (with category output)  
- âœ… **Data Conversion** (bit, byte, KB, MB, etc.)  
- âœ… **Date Difference Calculator** (dd/mm/yyyy format)  
- âœ… **Speed Conversion** (km/h, m/s, mph)  
- âœ… **Numeral System Converter** (Binary, Octal, Decimal, Hexadecimal)  

## ðŸ“š Technologies & Concepts Used

- C Programming Language  
- Functions & Modular Coding  
- Loops and Conditional Statements  
- Formatted Output (printf)  
- User Input Handling  
- Simple UI through Menu-Driven CLI  

## ðŸŽ¯ What I Learned

- Strengthened core C programming skills  
- Applied logical thinking to real-world problems  
- Hands-on experience with creating utility tools in C  
- Gained confidence in CLI-based software development
