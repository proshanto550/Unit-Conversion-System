Project Description:

The Unit Conversion and BMI Calculation Tool is a simple, interactive, and user-friendly console application that allows users to perform various unit conversions and calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI). The tool provides a clean and easy-to-navigate menu system, guiding users through multiple conversion categories such as area, time, and data units, alongside a BMI calculation feature. The objective of the project is to create an all-in-one solution that is easily accessible for anyone needing unit conversions or health-related measurements in a compact format.

Key Features:

Area Conversion:

Converts between square kilometers, hectares, and square meters.
Allows users to input the value in one unit and get the result in the other units of area.

Time Conversion:

Provides conversion between hours, minutes, and seconds.
Can convert seconds into the format “Hour:Minute
” for easy readability.

Data Conversion:

Converts data units such as bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, and terabytes.
Useful for anyone dealing with digital storage or file sizes.

BMI Calculator:

Calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a person’s weight (kg) and height (cm).
Classifies BMI into different categories like Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, and Obese.

Interactive Menu System:

Simple, menu-driven system that allows users to easily navigate through the options and get the results instantly.

Clear and Precise Output:

Provides accurate results with the appropriate units, and BMI results are accompanied by clear classifications based on standard health categories.

Limitations:

No Input Validation:

The program does not have proper input validation for non-numeric or invalid input, which could lead to runtime errors or incorrect results if the user enters inappropriate data.

Limited User Interface:

The tool is console-based, with a text menu. It does not provide a graphical user interface (GUI), making it less accessible for users who may not be familiar with console applications.

Lack of Advanced Features:

The tool is focused on basic unit conversions and BMI calculation. It doesn't support more complex conversions or additional units like temperature, volume, or currency.

No Unit Category Expansion:

The current program includes only a limited number of unit categories (Area, Time, Data). The tool can be expanded to cover other categories like temperature, energy, etc., in future versions.
